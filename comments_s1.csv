103,@_infinitetea That‚Äôs the premise of this show on Apple TV called severance lol. They get a brain procedure to where their memories are separated between work and personal lives.

 And the cut to black. Perfection. Gonna be a long wait for season two. #Severance https://t.co/z8lCMkUTDC"
1315,The season finale for #Severance came out today. This show progressively got better as it went along. Highly recommended.
1316,Just finished the first season of #Severance. One of the best shows I‚Äôve watched in a long time. It reminds me of Black Mirror if they entire show was based on one singular concept.
1317,"Did anyone else think that Severance (the TV show) was an adaptation of Severance (the novel) or was that just me? I haven't consumed either of them, but just assumed that this new TV show was based on the popular book from a few years ago...and then I looked up plot summaries."
1318,"@PunkRokMomJeans I took a week‚Äôs free of Apple + to watch (ü§Æ) but accidentally forgot about Severance. Did watch Schmigadoon though, which was great."
1319,"so, that #Severance finale was super tense and quite brilliant @mradamscott @BenStiller @AppleTV https://t.co/1hwjm1dPit"
1320,"I just finished the last episode of Severance's first season. Best new TV show in the last 2 years, and if it continues like that AND it has only a 3-4 season arc with a definite ending already planned, then one of the best ever. Don't miss it."
1321,Severance' creator answers (some of) our burning questions about that mind-blowing finale https://t.co/wEdeiRoaUy

1326,Wow. Severance constantly builds and drew my attention in. That cliffhanger though! We are all severed for a year eagerly awaiting Season 2 @AppleTVPlus! Congratulations @DanErixon @BenStiller on a brilliant ride that is vitally important viewing in these times.
1327,"@aarondigruccio @LiterallyNuts @BenStiller @AppleTVPlus Generally I agree. The Morning Show has been fantastic, albeit entirely different from Severance. The documentary on Billie Eilish was also fabulous. The only show that I didn‚Äôt keep up with was foundation. Just lost interest, unfortunately."
1328,"If you haven‚Äôt watched #severance on @AppleTVPlus , you must watch it. This is the best show ever. Season 1 finale aired today and I cried it was so good. So many emotions. Also FYI, I commented on @mradamscott Instagram story but he hasn‚Äôt responded yet. Lol"

1354,@claireeshaffer you cannot release a show called Severance two years after the start of a pandemic and not expect people to make this mistake
1355,"#Severance might be the best show on TV. Started out just weird enough to keep my interest, with a very deliberate pace. And I was literally on the edge of my seat watching the finale."
1356,now why did I think this whole time that Severance the TV show was based on Severance the book
1357,"the weekly Apple TV baseball game being the Mets, on the same day the Severance finale is released, is very Mets"
