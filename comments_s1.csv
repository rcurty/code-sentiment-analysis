103,@_infinitetea That’s the premise of this show on Apple TV called severance lol. They get a brain procedure to where their memories are separated between work and personal lives. So their consciousness is basically switched off for 8 hours a day and then they “wake up” when they leave work.
104,The way I am screaming at this Severance season finale! OMGGG!

112,@AppleTV wholey mother lover the #Severance season finale GOT ME! I am already having anxiety for season 2! LFG 😲😵‍💫
113,watching Severance due to @jmdornbush and Mark talking so positively about it. This show is great but it puts the fear in me that Big Companies will take Lumon as a good example to follow
114,#Severance just pulled off one of the best season finales I’ve ever seen. Masterpiece of a show!
115,"""Severance"" WOW... Lynchian minimalist phycological sci-fi. ONE of a kind show. So well done and deeply strange. Just watched the whole season and still I'm perplexed, and fascinated. 9.7 outta 10... again WOW. #Severance #scifi #thriller #AppleTV"

 What do y’all think is in Lumen’s future?"
124,My god... the Severance season 1 finale was one of the best I've EVER seen. 🤯
125,"So I'm watching this show, super into the mystery and the sci-fi nature of it all, mesmerized by the storytelling, coming up with my own thoughts and theories. Then they walk into a goat room and I'm starting back at 0 again. #Severance https://t.co/f8X6TTZJ6Y"

131,"Severance is intriguing. Ostensibly about corporate drone life, but I wonder how the actors related to it, as people whose job is literally to show up to work and act like a different person. (Also, I gather from this show that folks do NOT want to go back to the office.)"
132,"@mradamscott @StephenKing I start so many shows and give up because they just don't draw me in, but #Severance is so amazing, I never want it to end! Keep it up, cannot wait for the next season 👏"
